  "description": "Burn-to-claim is an open protocol developed by Griffith researchers that aims to address cross-blockchain asset transfer between networks of blockchain in a decentralised manner. The design is to transfer assets from one blockchain network to another in a way that it is being burned (destroyed) from one blockchain network and re-created on the other blockchain network. This protocol has two components: an exit transaction to generate a self-verifiable transfer-proof that the asset is burned on the source network and an entry transaction to verify the validity of transfer-proof and to re-create the asset in the destination network.",
